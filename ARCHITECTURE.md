# Architecture Document

## Overview

The Clippy UI Project is structured into three main components:

- Agent Management: Handles the creation and management of AI agents.
- Chat Interface: Provides a user interface for interacting with the AI agents.
- Visual Cues: Provides visual feedback based on the agent's activities.

Each component is implemented as a Python class in its own file. The AgentInteraction class in the agent_interaction.py file serves as the main entry point for the application.

## Detailed Design

### Agent Management

The AgentManagement class is responsible for managing the AI agents. It provides methods for creating a new project, monitoring agent activity, managing agents (pausing, resuming), reviewing generated code, running tests, visualizing data, integrating with an IDE, and interacting with an avatar.

### Chat Interface

The ChatInterface class provides a user interface for interacting with the AI agents. It provides methods for starting a chat, providing feedback, and searching feedback.

### Visual Cues

The VisualCues class provides visual feedback based on the agent's activities. It provides methods for updating agent activity, project status, and code output.
