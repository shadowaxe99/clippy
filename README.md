# Clippy UI Project

This project is a user interface for interacting with an AI agent named Clippy.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory. Run the main.py file to start the application.

## Architecture

The project is structured into three main components:

- Agent Management: Handles the creation and management of AI agents.
- Chat Interface: Provides a user interface for interacting with the AI agents.
- Visual Cues: Provides visual feedback based on the agent's activities.

Each component is implemented as a Python class in its own file. The AgentInteraction class in the agent_interaction.py file serves as the main entry point for the application.
